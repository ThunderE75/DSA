> - Stability - when two elements have equal values, their relative order is preserved after sorting.
> - In Place Sorting - When it only requires a constant amount of extra memory space to perform the sorting.

- Stable 
- In Place Sorting 
- Comparison Sort
- Time Complexity - $O(n^2)$
- Space Complexity - $O(1)$
- Not Efficient for Large Datasets
